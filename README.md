# Sales-Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI

**Overview:**
This project helps companies with many stores globally. They often struggle to understand their sales because information is shared verbally and can be biased. We use Power BI to create interactive dashboards that show sales data clearly.

**Challenges:**
A pizza company faced similar issues, and we created a dashboard using MySQL and Power BI to help them make better decisions based on data.

**Approach:**

1. Understand the business problem.

2. Explore the data and create Querry report in SQL.

3. Clean the data.

4. Performed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations in Power BI.

5. Check and validate the results of Power BI with SQL results.

6. Create visual dashboards for better understanding.
